    "## Python: Self  - why  some varibale not using self??\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when defining methods within a class, the first parameter conventionally represents the instance of the class itself and is typically named self. This parameter is used to access instance variables and other methods within the class.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Local Variables: Variables that are used only within the scope of a method and don't need to be accessed outside of it can be defined without self. These variables are typically used for temporary calculations or storage within the method.\n",

    "    Class Attributes Accessed via self: Class attributes, including instance variables and other methods, are accessed using self. These are variables or methods that belong to the instance of the class and can be accessed across different methods within the class.\n",

    "python\n",
    "\n",
