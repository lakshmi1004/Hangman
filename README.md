# How to Use

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Copy the provided code into a Python script.
    Run the script, and the game will start.
    Follow the prompts to guess letters of the secret word.
# A description of the project:
    
    Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

#  Aim of the project:
    Create this Hangman project in OOPS
    
# what it does:
    1.Set Up the Game Structure: Create the basic structure of the game, including initializing variables such as the word to be guessed, the number of allowed guesses, and the guessed letters.

    2.Display Initial Interface: Print out the initial interface of the game, which could be a series of underscores representing each letter in the word to be guessed, along with any relevant information like remaining guesses.

    3.Implement Guessing Logic: Allow the player to input guesses. Validate the input to ensure it's a single letter. Check if the guessed letter is in the word and update the interface accordingly.

    4.Update Game State: Keep track of the state of the game, including the guessed letters, remaining guesses, and the current state of the word being guessed.

    5.Handle Win/Loss Conditions: Check if the player has guessed all the letters in the word or if they have run out of guesses. If so, end the game and display an appropriate message.

    6.Add Hangman Art: Optionally, you can include ASCII art for the hangman that updates with each incorrect guess to make the game more visually appealing.

    7.Provide Replay Option: After the game ends, ask the player if they want to play again. If yes, reset the game and start over.
    
# what you learned:
## Lessons Learned
In the process of developing the Hangman Game, the following key lessons are:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and attributes.
- How to handle user input and validate it to ensure the program operates correctly.
- String manipulation techniques for comparing strings, extracting substrings, and formatting output.
- Algorithmic problem-solving skills, particularly in determining the game logic and implementing the win/lose conditions.
- How to structure a Python project, organize code into modules and functions, and manage dependencies.

- Git Hub - local - remote synchronization
    
    If your local repository is not synchronized with the remote (usually called "origin"), it means your local master branch is not up to date with the master branch on the remote repository.

Here's what you can do to sync your local master branch with the remote master branch:

    Check Remote Status: First, ensure that your local repository is aware of the remote repository and that you have the correct remote URL configured. You can do this by running:

git remote -v

This command will show you the remote repositories associated with your local repository.

Fetch Changes from Remote: Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository. This command will not merge the changes into your local branch; it will only download the latest changes from the remote:

sql

git fetch origin

Merge Changes into Local Branch: Once you have fetched the changes, you can merge them into your local master branch. If you're sure you want to merge the remote master into your local master, you can do this:

bash

git merge origin/master

Resolve Conflicts (if any): If there are any merge conflicts, Git will notify you. You'll need to resolve these conflicts manually by editing the affected files and then committing the changes.

Push Changes (if desired): After merging the changes and resolving any conflicts, you might want to push your updated master branch to the remote repository to keep it in sync:

perl

git push origin master

Verify: Verify that your local master branch is now up to date with the remote by checking the commit history or comparing the branches:

bash

    git log
    git branch -vv

These steps should help you synchronize your local master branch with the remote master branch. Make sure to understand the implications of fetching and merging changes, especially if you're working in a team environment.

        
## Installation
To run the Hangman game, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the command `python hangman.py` to start the game.
    
## Usage
Once the game is running, follow the prompts to guess letters and try to uncover the secret word. You have a limited number of lives, so be careful with your guesses!
