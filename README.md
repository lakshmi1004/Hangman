# How to Use

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Copy the provided code into a Python script.
    Run the script, and the game will start.
    Follow the prompts to guess letters of the secret word.
# A description of the project:
    
    Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

#  Aim of the project:
    Create this Hangman project in OOPS
    
# what it does:
    1.Set Up the Game Structure: Create the basic structure of the game, including initializing variables such as the word to be guessed, the number of allowed guesses, and the guessed letters.

    2.Display Initial Interface: Print out the initial interface of the game, which could be a series of underscores representing each letter in the word to be guessed, along with any relevant information like remaining guesses.

    3.Implement Guessing Logic: Allow the player to input guesses. Validate the input to ensure it's a single letter. Check if the guessed letter is in the word and update the interface accordingly.

    4.Update Game State: Keep track of the state of the game, including the guessed letters, remaining guesses, and the current state of the word being guessed.

    5.Handle Win/Loss Conditions: Check if the player has guessed all the letters in the word or if they have run out of guesses. If so, end the game and display an appropriate message.

    6.Add Hangman Art: Optionally, you can include ASCII art for the hangman that updates with each incorrect guess to make the game more visually appealing.

    7.Provide Replay Option: After the game ends, ask the player if they want to play again. If yes, reset the game and start over.
